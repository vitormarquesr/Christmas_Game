# Christmas Game
The purpose of this repository is to analyse mathematically strategies of a proposed game

## Proposed Game
A family decided to play a different kind of Secret Santa on Christmas. The rules are as follows: 

* Each participant buys a present, wraps it so nobody can see the content and places it together with the other presents.
*  A distinct integer number is given to each player indicating their turn.
* On his turn, the player has two possibilities, to pick a gift from the pile, reveal its content and keep it, or to take a gift from one of the previous players. The participant who had his gift taken is obligated to pick another present from the pile.
* The game keeps going until the player who was assigned the last number has played.

Suppose there are n people playing and your number is k.

**What is the best strategy? Is it better to take a present from another player or to pick one from the pile? How are the other participants going to play?**
